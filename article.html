			<p>If you’ve ever wondered what music your dog is into, a recent study by the Scottish SPCA and the University of Glasgow might have your answer, as the BBC points out. After playing a variety of music for their test subjects, the researchers concluded that dogs were particularly interested in reggae and soft rock, as they “showed the highest positive changes in behavior” while listening to these genres, Professor Neil Evans said in a press release.<br><br>

However, Professor Evans also suggested that this might not represent the taste of all dogs: “Overall, the response to different genres was mixed,” he said, “highlighting the possibility that, like humans, our canine friends have their own individual music preferences.”<br><br>

The study also suggested that dogs appreciate all music, regardless of genre, spending “significantly more time lying and significantly less time standing” while it was being played, the BBC reports. It is worth noting that during the study, only five genres were tested—soft rock, Motown, pop, reggae, and classical. So, the jury is still out on how dogs feel about tropical house and black metal. <br><br>

In 2015, the Scottish SPCA and University of Glasgow released a study showing that classical music also helped dogs relax.</p>
